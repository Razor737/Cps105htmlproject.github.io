			<h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
			<p>
				I am a freshman at				
				 <a href="http://www.bju.edu/">Bob Jones University</a>.
				 I am an Information Technology major, and I am eager to learn more everyday.
			</p>
			<p>
				I enjoy being around friends and family, playing sports, and being out in nature.
				
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm also excited to start going on outreaches with my society and with
				<a href="http://www.bjucgo.com/gogreenville.html">Go Greenville</a>.
				In Matthew 9:37-38 Jesus says, "Then He said to His disciples, â€œThe harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest."
